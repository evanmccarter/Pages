				When geese find a mate, they stay together with their mate forever. Geese typically have 5 goslings per year. Baby geese are called goslings.
				Goslings will be able to fly within 2-3 months after birth. Geese will return to their place of birth at least once a year to mate and have 
				children. If you see one single goose, then that means that the nest in nearby and he is the lookout. Geese tend to nest nearby the water to
				have an easy escape from predators. Geese migration distance can range from 2 to 3 thousand miles.(information retrieved from
