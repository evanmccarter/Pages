				Sea turtles are on of Earth's oldest creatures. There are seven species. They have been around for
				110 million years. The sea turtle's shell is called a carapace,  which is key to their swimming. 
				Sea turtles cannot retract their head and legs into their shell. Green sea turtles can stay under
				water for as long as 5 hours, because their heart rate actually slows down to conserve oxygen. 9 minutes
				may pass between heartbeats. (information retrieved from
