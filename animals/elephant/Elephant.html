				Elephants form deep family bonds. They live in herds where the leader is the oldest female.
				A herd can have anywhere between 8 and 100 indivulas. When a calf is born the entire raises
				and protects the child. Elephants are very smart and have memroies that spans for years.
				They show signs of grief, joy, anger and play. They can communicate by producing a sub-sonic
				rumble. Unfortually elephants are endangered because they are heavily hunted for the ivory in
				their tusks.(information retrieved from
